## Reflection

  - What was the context for this project? (ie: was this a side project? was this for Turing? was this for an experiment?)
  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
  - What were some unexpected obstacles?
  - What tools did you use to implement this project?

#### Example:  

This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Spoonacular API based on cuisine criteria, such as 'italian food' or 'chinese food'. However, I thought that a Meal Prep Generator would be more useful to utilize as a common struggle is deciding what to cook. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.

One of the main challenges I ran into was learning how to properly read through API Documentation. As I have familiarized myself with other APIs, it is crucial to break down the specific details that differentiate each command.
